# 2D-Platformer

This repository contains the files for a 2D Platformer game my group and I created as part of our grade 12 computer science ISU. Credits go to Paul Vincent whose tutorial series we used to create the game. The final product can be viewed using the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3uoyxY6Wak&feature=youtu.be
